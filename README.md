# TDApolloCodeGen
This is a macOS app that generates the Swift code that creates an API for Github. 

## How to run
Created with XCode. Just open the proj file, hit run and tap the button.

The code generates a Swift Package in a `generate` folder in the root of the project folder.

This SPM can then be added to an xcode project via SPM - https://github.com/elprl/TDApolloCodeGen .
